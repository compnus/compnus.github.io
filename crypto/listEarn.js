Main mine allows you to mine wBTC which can be used to upgrade $WM mine or exchanged for wUSDT to upgrade main mine, USDT mine and LABR mine. Every day you can also solve a case for extra wUSDT! USDT mine allows you to mine for USDT from the community pool. Be sure to mine as much as possible, because the supply is limited! LABR mine is connected to Labrador Adventures (see banner below) and allows you to mine $LABR based on your Labrador's speed + miner level. $LABR will be transfered to Labrador Adventures from which it can be withdrawn. Finally, the $WM Miner is the latest addition to WeMine! After the TGE, you can use this mine to collect your airdrop rewards, as well as mine for $WM or solve cases for even more $WM!",

And why is my withdrawal processing for 2 months already? Yeah I don't think this app is worth the pain. Pain huh? Well basically you get 5 spins per day, which is exactly what you'd expect it to be. Lame rewards. The good rewards come when you watch ads. One ad per spin, up to 30 per day. That sound as bad, but it's horrible. See, sometimes the app doesn't register you watching the ad. So it will force you into watching another one. This can continue into a super annoying loop of up to 10 ads per spin. Also sometimes the spin just doesn't work? That ad plays, another one isn't forced on you, but the wheel just... doesn't spin? Also this app contains a casino. Please no matter what you do, do not deposit.",
